I'm not a huge fan of LibreOffice (although it seems to regularly get better), so I normally don't have a ton of options for slideshow presentations. Normally, I go with $$\LaTeX$$'s Beamer, but so far there aren't really any opportunities for animations, animated gifs, or other interactive content. This year, I tried [Slides, Inc's][0] online presentation creator, and while not a perfect product (online-only, subscription model), it does have some really cool features as well (iframe support, intuitive UI, simple, clean format for animation and presentation).
