As a linux user, I'm not a huge fan of LibreOffice (although it seems to regularly get better), so I generally don't have a ton of options for slideshow presentations. Normally, I go with $$\LaTeX$$'s Beamer, but so far there aren't really any opportunities for animations, animated gifs, or other interactive content. This year, I tried [Slides, Inc's][0] online presentation creator, and while not a perfect product (online-only, subscription model), it does have some really cool features as well (iframe support, intuitive UI, simple, clean format for animation and presentation). You can either check out the embedded preview of the final result, or view the full presentation as a standalone page [here][1].
