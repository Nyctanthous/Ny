<p>In my day-to-day programming, I tend to use an eccentric combination of Python,
Java, and LaTeX to cover most of my needs. While I use other applications to
deal with LaTeX and Java, Python is an interesting language to find an IDE for.</p>

<p>I could use the ever-popular Jupyter Notebook for my light programming needs,
but this really proves insufficient when  I want to sit down and write
something like a package, which happens reasonably often.</p>

<p>Granted, I could use something like PyCharm or Spyder, but they’re both kind
 of bulky, and Spyder is ugly as hell. Enter Atom, a semi-lightweight tool that
 is truly based on the idea of expandability. Want functionality? Pull an
 extension off of git for it. Don’t like the interface? Pull an extension. Want
 to program in Julia? Pull an extension. This approach is quite powerful, and
 is emulated in other tools such as the unfortunately named Visual Studio Code,
 which is a very different entity than the bloated mess that is Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Both Sublime Text and Light Table are similar tools, yet both lack the same
 degree of community support that Atom has. Because of this, I tend to opt for
 Atom.</p>

 <em>Atom can be as attractive as you want it to be. Shown is the Atom Material
 theme with Aurora syntax.</em></p>

<h3 id="theme-pairings-i-use">Theme Pairings I use:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UI: Atom Material</li>
  <li>Syntax: Aurora or Solarized Dark</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plugins-i-use">Plugins I use:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Script - acts as if you ran your program through the terminal. Requires that
the language you want to use is already installed, just like everyone else.
A must-have in order to execute code.</li>
  <li>linter-pylama - a very aggressive Python (PEP-8) linter with a nice text
readout showing exactly where you went wrong.</li>
  <li>beautify - format your ugly code already. Works with almost every language
out there.</li>
  <li>Hydrogen - Because of the Python development I do, sometimes it’s nice just
to write a quick script and let it give a Jupyter-style output, like a graph.
Hydrogen’s features are too many to list, but let it suffice to say that
it’s awesome.</li>
</ul>
