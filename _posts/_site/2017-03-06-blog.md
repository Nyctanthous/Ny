## Platform

I use a Linux Mint 18.1 system to generate a site that is hosted on [GitHub Pages](1). To generate the site, I use the static site generator [Pelican](2). (EDIT: Now, Jekyll!) As Pelican is Python-based, I keep everything in different (possibly conflicting) virtual enviroments with the virtual enviroment tool <kbd>venv</kbd>.

The packages I use are largely as follows:

| Package  |    Version   |     Package    | Version      |
| :------- | :----------: | :------------: | :----------- |
| Markdown |     2.6.6    |    nbconvert   | 4.0 or later |
| pelican  |     3.6.3    | beautifulsoup4 |              |
| jupyter  | 1.0 or later |   ghp-import   | 0.4.1        |
| ipython  | 4.0 or later |   matplotlib   | 1.5.1        |

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Writing posts:

Posts are written in Markdown, and support standard Markdown. Pelican can be extended to use MathJax and Markdown Extra.
